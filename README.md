# Lingo

This app gamifies learning a new language, through Hangman. Focusing on vocabulary a random word is selected from the database and shown to the user. The user chooses the language to learn, then has to guess the correct spelling of the selected word translated into their chosen language. The user has a limited number of guesses, with each wrong guess, a part of the hangman is drawn to the screen.
